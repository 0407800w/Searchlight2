MA plot for the comparison between <*PDE_numerator*> and <*PDE_denominator*>. Significantly differential genes (p.adj < <*PDE_padj*>, absolute log2 fold > <*PDE_log2fold*>) are shown in red and nonâˆ’significant genes in black. A positive fold change indicates higher expression in <*PDE_numerator*> than in <*PDE_denominator*>.
