Network plots of: all significantly enriched upstream regulators (p.adj < <*IPA_UREG_padj*>, absolute log2 fold > <*IPA_UREG_log2fold*>), and all significantly activated or repressed upstream regulators (activated > <*IPA_UREG_zscore*>, repressed < -<*IPA_UREG_zscore*>), highlighting significance and upstream regulators interconnectivity. For each network nodes represent gene sets and edges represent two gene sets with a Szymkiewicz-Simpson coefficient of at least <*IPA_UREG_overlap*>. For the enrichment network enrichment was calculated using Hypergeometric Gene Set Enrichment on all significantly differentially expressed genes (p.adj < <*PDE_padj*>, absolute log2 fold > <*PDE_log2fold*>). Node colour represents -log10 enrichment p-value, with red as higher significance and white as lower significance. For the activated or repressed upstream regulators network activation was calculated using the IPA-like algorithm (see methods) based on all differential expression values. Node colour represents activation z-score, with red as activation and blue as repression. Node size represents the number of significantly differential genes within the node.
