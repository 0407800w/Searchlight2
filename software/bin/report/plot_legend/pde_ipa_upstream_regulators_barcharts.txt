Summary bar charts of the ten most enriched, activated and repressed upstream regulators between <*PDE_numerator*> and <*PDE_denominator*>. For the enrichment plot enrichment was calculated using Hypergeometric Gene Set Enrichment on all significantly differentially expressed genes (p.adj < <*PDE_padj*>, absolute log2 fold > <*PDE_log2fold*>). The -log10 enrichment p-value is given on the x-axis and the upstream regulator name on the y-axis. Significantly enriched upstream regulators (p.adj < <*IPA_UREG_padj*>, absolute log2 fold > <*IPA_UREG_log2fold*>) are coloured red and non-significant black. Data labels represent the number of significantly differential expressed genes controlled by the regulator. For the activated and repressed plots activation was calculated using the IPA-like algorithm (see methods) based on all differential expression values. The activation score is given on the x-axis and the upstream regulator name on the y-axis. Significantly activated or repressed upstream regulators (activated > <*IPA_UREG_zscore*>, repressed < -<*IPA_UREG_zscore*>) are coloured red and non-significant black. Upstream regulator analysis was performed on the databases <*IPA_UREG_databases*>.
