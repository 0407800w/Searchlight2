Summary bar chart of the ten most underenriched genes sets for: all significantly differentially expressed genes (p.adj < <*PDE_padj*>, absolute log2 fold > <*PDE_log2fold*>) between <*PDE_numerator*> and <*PDE_denominator*>, significantly upregulated genes and significantly downregulated genes. Upregulated genes are higher expression in <*PDE_numerator*> than in <*PDE_denominator*>. For each plot the -log10 under enrichment p-value is given on the x-axis and the gene set name on the y-axis. Data labels represent the number of significantly differential expressed genes within each gene set. Enrichment analysis was performed using Hypergeometric Gene Set Enrichment on the gene set databases <*hypergeom_gene_set_databases*>. Significantly underenriched gene sets (p.adj < <*hypergeom_gene_set_padj*>, absolute log2 fold > <*hypergeom_gene_set_log2fold*>) are coloured red and non-significant black.
