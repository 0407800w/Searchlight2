This multiple pairwise differential expression (MPDE) workfow report was generated using Searchlight 2 (<*SL2_version*>). The normalised expression matrix at <*normexp_file_path*> was combined with the background file at <*background_file_path*>, retaining only the <*expression_set_size*> genes that were present in both, to create the "expression set". Per sample group mean expression values and standard devitations per gene were calulated using numpy.  The differential expression data for each of the comparisons: <*mpde_comparisons*>, was processed as stated in the individual pairwise differential expression (PDE) workflow reports and combined with the expression set data. Only genes in the expression set were included. Significance thresholds for each comparison were as each relevant PDE worokflow report. Finally, all plots were generated as described in the figure legends of this report, using the R script at /MPDE/<*workflow_ID*>/plots/workflow.r, .
